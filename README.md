This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala related to generic types and type inference. Specifically, it showcases how unexpected behavior can occur when using generic classes with lists.  The `bug.scala` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.scala` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from how the compiler handles the `toString` method when dealing with complex types within generic classes.
